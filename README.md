### Thought

today was a good starting point, i learned how to open files and read its content.
but it was just about 30 minutes of codig, you know! its friday and i spend most of the day with my family.
it was nice. but i promise spend more time on this.
know its 17:35 and i want to go for a walk, maybe work more on this tonight.
tomorrow is a big waorking day, hell yeah.
also its nice to wite this with vim. i like it..
...
well its 23:16 and after a lot of try and error i fond c++ to be very hard.
but not surprised. its enough for today.
...
yeah, i don't know why im reinventing the wheel ðŸ¤”
but its cool, im learning about parsing and im having fun. i like c++
